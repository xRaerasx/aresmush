# Aspirations
This command lets you record your character's aspirations.  Aspirations are only visible to yourself and staff, and may be changed at any time.

`asps`` - Show you own aspirations.

Example: 

Typing asps would show your aspirations in this manner (if following the format in the second example)

1. Short-term asp 1 text
2. Short-term asp 2 text
3. Long term asp text

`asps/set <asp>` - Sets your goals.

Example: 

asps/set 1. short-term asp 1 text %r%r 2. short-term asp 2 text %r%r 3. long-term asp text

Characters with the "view_bgs" permission can view another character's aspirations using `asps <name>`.
