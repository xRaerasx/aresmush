# Traits

You can set descriptive traits on your character.

`traits <name>` - Lists traits for a character.
`trait/set <title>=<description>` - Sets a trait.
`trait/remove <title>` - Removes a trait.

Admins with the `manage\_apps` permission can set other peoples' traits:

`trait/set <name>=<title>/<description>`
