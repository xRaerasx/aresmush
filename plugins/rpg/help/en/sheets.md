# Character Sheet

The `sheet` command lets you view your character sheet, showing your abilities.

Some games may allow you to view other character's sheets.  This information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

`sheet` - Views your own sheet.
`sheet <name>` - Views someone else's sheet.
  
During chargen, you can set your character sheet using the web chargen or the sheet commands. Admins can edit other sheets.

`sheet/set [<name>=]<sheet>` - Sets the main character sheet info.
`sheet/notes [<name>=]<notes>` - Sets any supplementary notes about your sheet.
